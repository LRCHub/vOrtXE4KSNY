Last night, no way, I was gonna be left hungry
And then your daddy caught me sneakin' out your bed
It's just a game I play
It's just I roll that way
Don't think, sweet baby, I'm messin' with your head
I'm a smooth rider, baby
You know I just keep movin' on
Don't know why I like to carry on the way I do
It's just that I'm in love with you
Hey if you see me out there runnin'
And you head those sirens comin'
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand
If you know they're comin' for me
And you know they're runnin' for me
You know my love won't let them keep me away
I'm a smooth rider, baby
You know I just keep movin' on
Don't know why I like to carry on the way I do
It's just that I'm in love with you
You see me out there runnin'
And you hear the sirens comin'
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand
If you know they're comin' for me
And you know they're runnin' for me
You know my love won't let them keep me away
I'm a smooth rider, baby
Oh I'm a smooth rider, baby
I'll be out there runnin'
